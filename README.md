# University Salaries of Graduates by Major Data Analysis

## Introduction

College degrees are expensive, and it's crucial to understand their potential financial returns. This data analysis project delves into the salaries of graduates by major, using data from PayScale Inc. The goal is to determine the highest and lowest-earning majors, as well as the majors with the highest earning potential and lowest risk.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is sourced from a year-long survey conducted by PayScale Inc., encompassing 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree. The dataset is available in the file 'salaries_by_college_major.csv'.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this data analysis project are as follows:

- Identify majors with the highest starting salaries
- Determine majors with the lowest earnings after college
- Analyze majors with the highest earning potential
- Assess the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint
- Compare the average earnings between business, STEM, and HASS degrees

## Data Cleaning and Exploration

The initial steps involved exploring the dataset using the Pandas library in Python. The project covered data cleaning, handling missing values, and basic exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

## Analysis Techniques

The analysis used various techniques in the Pandas library, including sorting values, adding columns, grouping data, and creating pivot tables. These techniques enabled the extraction of valuable insights from the dataset, such as identifying majors with the most potential and those with the lowest risk.

## Conclusion

Through this data analysis, we discovered valuable insights into the earning potential of various college majors. The findings shed light on the financial prospects of different fields of study, providing guidance for prospective students and their families.

## Requirements

To run the analysis code, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3
